# Atmega328p-Arkitektur-design-labb3

Using the ADC on a Arduino uno to read a potentiometer, digital ports to read buttons and using timer/compare for timing.

A yellow LED is connected to digital port 6 with a 330ohm pulldown resistor.
The button that's being used is connected to digital port 12 with a 1k ohm resistor, labeled key2 on the shield.
The potentiometer(10k ohm) is connected to Analog port 0.
